Keep It Simple, Stupid!

I've heard this phrase so many times in software engineering! One of my team leads once said, "It's easier to make things complex but much harder to start simple." This idea really resonated with me this week. I've been thinking a lot about doing things one step at a time and simplifying things, both at work and in life.

It turns out this philosophy doesn't just apply to engineering or personal growthâ€”it's just as true for improv. And that's exactly what we focused on in class today. Keeping it simple makes it so much easier to initiate and heighten scenes. It was a total light bulb moment for me, and I couldn't be happier about how it clicked.

Here are two scenes I worked on in class that really reinforced the importance of simplicity:

**First Suggestion: Groundhog Day**

This scene started with me pretending to be a groundhog, which I feel set the tone right away.

> Partner: Hey groundhog, what's the temperature going to be like tomorrow?
> Me: It's going to be really hot.
> Partner: What about the day after tomorrow?
> Me: It's going to be really, really hot.
> Partner: What about after two days?
> Me: It's going to be scorching hot.
> Partner: Is there any point in living on this planet anymore?
> Me: I don't think so.

And scene!

Notice how with every question, the temperature increased? By keeping the structure simple, we were able to heighten the stakes naturally. The relationship was clear right from the start (a curious human and an all-knowing groundhog), and we leaned into the absurdity of the situation. This scene got a lot of laughs in class, which is always a win! (and gave me so much dopamine!).

**Second Suggestion: Socks**

> Partner: Did you steal my socks?
> Me: Yes.
> Partner: Did you also steal my jacket?
> Me: Yes.
> Partner: Did you also steal my wife?
> Me: Yes.

And that's it!

Once again, simplicity was key. We built a pattern (question -> simple answer) and raised the stakes with each line. 

Both scenes were structurally sound and fun to perform. What stood out to me was how much easier everything felt when we embraced simplicity. We didn't have to overthink or explain; we just followed the patterns and let the scenes unfold naturally.

This class really drove home the idea that keeping things simple isn't just a nice-to-haveâ€”it's the foundation for great work, whether in improv, at work, or in life.

Here's to more simplicity and light bulb moments! ðŸ’¡

Also, shoutout to my partners Anthony & Sofia for these scenes!
