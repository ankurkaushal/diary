I realized the other day that there's a very subtle difference between reacting and responding in improv. One is based on impulse, and the other is based on groundedness. Why does being grounded matter? Simply because when you're grounded, you can help create more magical scenes on stageâ€”scenes that make sense, scenes in which you're not second-guessing yourself (like I do most of the time).

Why am I talking about groundedness? Because this was one of the things the Neutral Mask helps you achieve.

The Neutral Mask was very much the focus of the Physical Performance on Stage: Presence intensive I attended this past weekend.

What is the Neutral Mask, you ask? It's actually a mask! A blank, expressionless mask that forces the actor on stage to communicate through body language, breath, and movement.
