Writing about yourself is hard.

But hey, here goes!

Hi, I’m Ankur, currently based in North York. During the week, I work as a Senior Software Developer at Miovision, where I’m passionate about building tech to help cities tackle their traffic challenges.

When I’m not behind the computer, I’m usually chasing curiosity—whether it’s diving into improv (the art of saying “Yes, and!”), exploring new cuisines, or simply staying in to binge-watch TV shows and movies.

This blog is my little corner of the internet, where I share reflections on work, life, and the things that inspire me—like improv, tech, and the occasional deep dive into random rabbit holes.
