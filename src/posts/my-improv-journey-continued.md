title: You're doing improv, what!? - Part 2

Continuing my improv journey, I just wrapped up Level 2 this past weekend. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this much fun! One of the best parts was the diversity of the groupâ€”there were people in their 60s, an 18-year-old, lots of folks in their 20s, and me at 33. The range of ages brought so much valuable perspective. Plus, we had the privilege of learning from some truly talented teachers: [Ben Wright](https://www.instagram.com/bensosawright), [Kerry Griffin](https://www.kerry-griffin.com/) & [Hannah Spear](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3577954).

One of the key concepts we focused on was establishing the platform. If youâ€™re wondering what that means, itâ€™s the "who" (relationship), "what" (activity), and "where" (setting) of a scene. A successful scene often hinges on setting a solid and clear platform as early as possible. We were also encouraged to "go big"â€”using emotions, gestures, and objects to enhance our scenes.

We dove into the idea of statuses, where a character can be either high or low status. It's not just about social standing; it's more about how a character dominates a scene. For example, a beggar could play a high-status role by bossing around a low-status wealthy character who caves into every demand.

This term also emphasized emotions, with several games built around them. One game that stands out (though the exact name escapes me) was a "party game". In it, each player picked an emotion. The host starts the scene by setting up for a party, fully embracing their chosen emotion. One by one, guests arrive, each bringing their own emotion. The host tries to guess and then mirrors the guest's emotion. As more players join, everyone has to quickly adapt to the new emotions in the room, leading to a lively, constantly shifting atmosphere. Eventually, players begin leaving in reverse order, returning to their original emotions until the host is left alone, back to where they started.

A big personal takeaway for me was learning to fully commit to whatever choice I make in a scene. This often meant giving myself permission to fail, which, if you ask me, is a valuable life lesson too.

One of the standout moments of Level 2 was trying out musical improv! We were all pretty nervous at first, but it ended up being a surprisingly enjoyable experienceâ€”though I'm not sure any of us are eager to repeat it. I know I'm not!

Before I wrap this up, here are a few highlights from the class that I won't forget:

* Jacob's fist bumps.
* Martina's legendary use of imaginary guns.
* Our whiteboard drawings where we "yes, and"-ed each other's ideas.
* Sam's thought-provoking perspectives.

There are probably more highlightsâ€”so if anyone from the class is reading this, feel free to remind me, and I'll add them to the list! ðŸ˜„

In closing, I just want to say what a privilege it was to get to know a lot of you in this class. Hearing so many personal stories filled me with warmth, and I found myself opening up more than I usually do. Being able to be vulnerable without judgment made me really appreciate everyone. With that, I'm looking forward to Level 3 next month and canâ€™t wait to share more about it!
